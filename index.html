            <h2>What is Blog?</h2>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 16px; font-display:inherit;">A blog, short for weblog, is a frequently updated web page
                used for personal commentary or business content. Blogs are often interactive and include sections at
                the bottom of individual blog posts where readers can leave comments.Most are written in a
                conversational style to reflect the voice and personal views of the blogger. Some businesses use blogs
                to connect with target audiences and sell products.
                <br><br>
                Blogs were originally called weblogs, which were websites that consisted of a series of entries arranged
                in reverse chronological order, so the newest posts appeared at the top. They were frequently updated
                with new information about various topics.
                <br><br>
                Today's blogs are more likely to be a personal online journal or commentary related to a business that's
                frequently updated and intended for general public consumption. Blogs are still often defined by their
                format, consisting of a series of entries posted to a single page in reverse chronological order. Many
                blogs are collaborative and include multiple authors often writing on a single theme such as Engadget, a
                tech blog with multiple authors.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>What is a blog used for?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The first blog sites were essentially online personal diaries or journals. They became popular for their
                regular content updates, personal point of view, aggregation of interesting links, and the opportunity
                to engage in the comments section with the blogger and their audience.
                <br><br>
                Blogs have come a long way from their early days as online journals, though it's still a popular reason
                people create a blog. They've also become an important way for buyers to gather information about the
                products and services they're researching.
                <br><br>
                According to Gartner, most customers do much of their buying research online, spending only 5% of their
                time with sales reps. Responding to that trend, blogging has become an effective way for organizations
                to create authoritative content attractive to buyers conducting their own research. Most business blogs
                end by advertising their product in hopes readers are ready to buy after reading and learning from the
                blog.

            <h2>What is a blog post?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>A blog post is the piece of content in a blog. Posts are frequently updated and often organized in
                reverse chronological order with the newest blog post appearing at the top.
                <br><br>
                Each post covers a subtopic of the blog and links back to the blog itself. For instance, blog site
                Engadget focuses primarily on technology news and reviews of consumer electronics. Each blog post covers
                a specific piece of electronic or technology news. But posts on the site also cover topics adjacent to
                electronics, such as movies and other forms of entertainment that overlap with the tech space. For
                example, one post looks at a movie dramatization of the popular video game chain GameStop.
                <br><br>
                Bloggers use their posts to attract audiences and rank high on search engine results. Business blog
                posts are often used at the beginning of the sales funnel that describes a product buyer's journey. They
                serve as an audience's introduction to a business and its products. Bloggers can use these posts to
                build content around more keywords and topical trends that audiences are searching for and turn those
                visitors into customers.
